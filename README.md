Easily cycle-exchange an attached Monobehaviour-Script on a Gameobject in Unity. -> Made for CameraPostProcessing-FX

Hallo, I am David and I am a Computer-Science Student living in Germany. 

In order to use this , 

1.) import the package, 
2.) add the holder script to your camera 
3.) create an object or a prefab where you put all the monobehaviourscipts on it that you want to be able to cycle through - for this usecase postprocessing effects.
4.) create a Reference to the  Object on the Holder-Script. 
5.) Press Update List

Now you can star cycling. 
The focus-field will refer to the currently cycled script. 
You can drag in any other script on your gameobject that you want to cycle through 

It is meant to be able to cycle fast through postprocessing effects so that you can stay in an artistic flow and have fun.

Cheers :D
